This filw will eventually tell how how to setup a blank DB, For now it contains a few specifc notes.

"Keine User"
------------
There needs to be a 'keine' user, that all unknown machines are assigned to:
  insert into users set AssocNtAccount='keine';
  update systems set description='keine' where description='';

Other DB fixes:
  grant SELECT,UPDATE        ON inventory.vlan    to inventwrite@'%' ;
  ALTER TABLE `inventory`.`sys_os` ADD PRIMARY KEY(`id`);
