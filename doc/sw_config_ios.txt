Network Switch Configuration & Tips for Cisco IOS

# Initially, Switches must be configured to send a copy of syslog messages, and given the name of the vmps servers, where it can send requests for dynamic port assignment.
# See also http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps607/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a008007eba3.html#xtocid164834.


# Configuring VMPS :
  conf t 
  no vmps server 192.168.245.41
  vmps server 192.168.245.40
  vmps reconfirm 120
  end

  show vmps

# Re-authenticate all current connections
  vmps reconfirm

# Re-authenticate all current connection, by emptying the MAC table. Note that the previous “vmps reconfirm” will not re-allow systems that were previously denied. For that we need to clear the MAC table:
  clear mac-address-table dynamic

# Enable VMPS on port fa0/2:
  conf t
  int fa0/2
  switchport access vlan dynamic

#(Re-)enable static Vlan 8 on port fa0/2:
  conf t
  int fa0/2
  switchport access vlan 8

  # The switch tries to contact a server 3 times by default, before stopping. This value can be programmed on the switch (to a maximum of 10):
  vmps retry 5

  # The switch reconfirms by default every 60 minutes, make 2hr:
  vmps reconfirm 120

#Other commands
  show vmps stat
  clear vmps statistics
