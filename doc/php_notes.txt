This is a loose gatering of a few notes that may come in handy..
See "master_server_install.txt" for the current method we use for building PHP.



Access MS-SQL from PHP
----------------------
There seem to be several ways to do this.
Basically two libraries:

1) odbtp    odbtp.sourceforge.net
   cd /opt/install
   wget http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/odbtp/odbtp-1.1.4.tar.gz
   tar xvzf odbtp-1.1.4.tar.gz
   cd odbtp-1.1.4/
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/odbtp
   make install
  
   Then compile PHP with:   --with-odbtp-mssql=/opt/odbtp
   ==> Could not get this to work at all.
   
 2) Compile FreeTDS
   cd /opt/install
   wget http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/freetds/stable/release_candidates/freetds-0.64RC2.tar.gz
   tar xvzf freetds-0.64RC2.tar.gz
   cd freetds-0.64RC2
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/freetds --enable-msdblib
   make install

Then there are seveal ways to tell PHP use to FreeTDS:
a) pdo: havn't tried this yet --with-pdo-dblib=/opt/freetds
b) compiling with --with-sybase=/opt/freetds, but I had timeout problems on some queries.
c) --with-mssql=/opt/freetds  : This is what I'm currently using

  
PHP to try for the furture
