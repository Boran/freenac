The vmpsd is from OpenVMPS, the sources are in the subdirectory vmpsd.1.3.sources

We don't make any changes to it, but use and external plugin to start vmpsd_external, which is our program.

However, to get vmpsd running you need:
	/etc/init.d/vmps
	/opt/vmps/vmpsd             (the OpenVMPS binary)
	/opt/vmps/vmpsd_external
	/usr/local/etc/vlan.db      (empty dummy file, needed to start vmpsd)
