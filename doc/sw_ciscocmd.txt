====== Using 'ciscocmd' =========

This is a great tool for 'remote control' of Cisco switches. Some examples are below.

Download and extract, no compilation is needed.
These tests were done with v1.4, I installed in /opt/nac/ciscocmd-1.4.


One switch example:  (example switch is SWITCH1)
------------------
  ./ciscocmd -u USER -p MYPASS -t SWITCH1 -c "show vmps"
  ./ciscocmd -u USER -p MYPASS -t SWITCH1 -c "reconfirm vmps" -e  -s MYPASS
  ./ciscocmd -u USER -p MYPASS -t SWITCH1 -c "ping 192.168.1.40" -e  -s MYPASS  
  
  (change USER, MYPASS; and the enable password as needed..)


many switches
------------------
  # Get all CatOS switches (hw type 2948, store in catos.txt),
  echo "select name from switch where hw like '%2948%' order by name;" | mysql opennac |egrep -v name > catos.txt
  
  #  and check their vmps status:
  ./ciscocmd -u USER -p MYPASS -T catos.txt -c "show vmps" | egrep "VMPS Action|VMPS Last Accessed|Last Reconfirmation|show vmps"
