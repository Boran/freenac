History of this Branch 3.0
===========================

Created on 2007.11.16 from revision 1090 from svn

A substantial change in FreeNAC v3.0 is the introduction of an OO (objected oriented) policy interface, which provides greater flexibility and encapsulation of individual decisions regarding access to the network. The main programs have been rewritten using OO techniques, some others have been modified to work with our framework, and some others have been added to this new release.

The aim of the OO change is to have a modularized system which would be easier to debug, troubleshoot, maintain and extend in the long run.
It's now a requirement to use PHP 5 (not PHP4). We recommend always using the latest PHP version when installing new servers.
