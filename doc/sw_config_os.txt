Network Switch Configuration & Tips for Cat OS

#Initially, Switches must be configured to send a copy of syslog messages, and given the name of the vmps servers, where it can send requests for dynamic port assignment.
#See also http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps607/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a008007eba3.html#xtocid164834.

Set VMPS servers 
set vmps  server 192.168.245.40
set vmps  server 192.168.245.19 primary
set vmps  server 192.168.245.18

#Remove a VMPS server & show status
clear vmps server 192.168.245.19
show vmps

#Lets make a port dynamic & aks the switch to re-authenticate all dyn ports, i.e. use VMPS
set port membership 2/36 dynamic
reconfirm vmps

# To switch a port back to static Vlan (if you had problems)
set port membership 2/36 static

# To verify port
show port status 2/36

# to disable/enable port (simulate cable being removed)
set port disable 2/36
set port enable 2/36
#The switch tries to contact a server 3 times by default, before stopping. This value can be programmed on the switch (to a maximum of 10): 
set vmps server retry 5

#The switch reconfirms by default every 60 minutes, set it to 120:
set vmps server reconfirminterval 120

#Other useful commands:
show mac-address-table address 00:04:dd:b6:5c:c2

show arp

show cdp neighbors
show cdp neighbors Gi4/5
show cdp neighbors Gi4/5 detail

show cam 00:04:dd:b6:5c:c2
show cam dynamic 2/32
show port status 2/32

# Tag a name to a port (to document usage)
Set port name 2/32 webcam
