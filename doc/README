Currently we're using VMPS for authentication:
---------------------------------------------
VMPS (Dynamic Membership with VLAN Management Policy Server) allows authentication on the network connectivity layer. When a PC is connected to a switch, the switch sends the MAC address to a VMPS server, who replies saying access is allowed or denied and into which VLAN the PC is to be connected. 

This project is a practical implementation of “layer 2” authentication, with a view to improving network security by 
a)	Making it more difficult to unknown PCs to connect to the network.
b)	Making it more difficult for PCs to switch between networks of different security levels
c)	Enabling precise inventory of systems connected to the network.



Thanks and enjoy!
