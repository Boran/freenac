<h2> Introduction</h2>
 This article continues the series on LAN switching and Cisco Catalyst switches. 
This month we'll talk about dynamic VLAN's, and explain what VQP and VMPS 
are, as well as how they work and how to configure them. 
<p>Prior articles in the series: </p>

)</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h2> What are VQP and VMPS</h2>
 We talked in a prior article about configuring ports to belong to a VLAN. 
This is the static approach to VLAN's, where a port is always a member of
a specific VLAN. You can also configure a port to dynamically determine what
VLAN to belong to. Initially (and fundamentally) this process is tied to
the MAC address of the end station on the port. Cisco is in the process of
making this much more administrator-friendly (and useful!) by tying it into
directory servers -- more on that later. 
<p>There is a process whereby a switch with a dynamic port can query a server
with end station information to find out what VLAN the port should be in.
The query is done via VQP, VLAN Query Protocol. The query goes to a VMPS,
VLAN Membership Policy Server. The VMPS was initially a Catalyst 5xxx, but
this is in the process of changing to where the server is perhaps a workstation
running URT, User Response Tool, and eventually to perhaps a Windows 2000
Active Directory Server. </p>
<p>The following are capable of being VMPS servers right now: supervisor software
release 2.3 or later on Catalyst 5000 and 2926G series switches. Many of
the Cisco switches are capable of being VQP-using clients with dynamic VLAN's. 
</p>
<p>You can have several end stations on a dynamic port (using a hub), but 
they must all belong to the same dynamic VLAN. If there are more than 20 (29xx
XL) to 50 (Catalyst 5xxx) end stations on a single port, the dynamic port
will be shut down by the switch. </p>
<h2> Configuring VMPS</h2>
 Configuring VMPS is fairly simple, with only one minor surprise. (Troubleshooting 
it, however, may be a bit more complex). 
<h3> Catalyst Set-Based Configuration</h3>

<ul>
 <li> CCO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat5000/rel_5_1/config/vmps.htm">
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat5000/rel_5_1/config/vmps.htm</a>
  </li>
 
</ul>
 The basic command to start off with is 
<blockquote><tt>set vmps tftpserver <i>ip-address</i> [<i>filename</i>]</tt></blockquote>
 This tells the future VMPS server what TFTP server to get information from, 
and optionally what filename the information will be under. The default filename
is <tt>vmps-config-database.1</tt>. 
  <p>You then do a </p>
  <blockquote><tt>set vmps state enable</tt></blockquote>
 (the alternative being disable), upon which the wannabe VMPS server will 
attempt to download the configuration database specified with the tftpserver 
command. If the TFTP download succeeds, then VMPS will become enabled. If
the transfer fails, you'll get an error message and VMPS will remain disabled.
The download/enable process also takes place when you reboot the switch. 
    <p>You can force a download of new VMPS server information to a server 
with the command </p>
    <blockquote><tt>download vmps</tt></blockquote>
 This also can be used to retry after a download fails. 
      <p>To set up a set-based switch as a VQP client, you need to tell it
who its VMPS server is. This is done with the command </p>
      <blockquote><tt>set vmps server <i>server-ip-address </i>[primary]</tt></blockquote>
 You can do this up to three times, one primary and two backup VMPS servers. 
When the primary is down, it's status will be checked every five (5) minutes. 
When it is back up, queries will again be sent to the primary first. 
        <p>For there to be any point to having a client, you need to use
dynamic VLAN's. A port is made dynamic with the command </p>
        <blockquote><tt>set port membership <i>mod_num/port_num</i> dynamic</tt></blockquote>
 and the status will show up in the <tt>show port</tt> command output. Use 
the command 
          <blockquote><tt>reconfirm vmps</tt></blockquote>
 occasionally as enabled (privileged) user, if you wish to have the switch 
reconfirm all dynamic port VLAN assignments. 
            <p>The design intent appears to be for there to be a VMPS server
for local switches, say switches sharing a VTP domain. The point here is:
you probably do not want to have to reach your VMPS server through a router,
and if you do, it is the one Layer 3 switching hop to the server farm on
a campus (more on this if I write a switched campus design article). </p>
            <p>Other related commands: <br>

            <table border="1" width="100%">
 <tbody>
                <tr>
 <td><tt>clear vmps server</tt></td>
  <td>This command deletes a VMPS server from the list of servers in the client
switch.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>clear vmps statistics</tt></td>
  <td>This resets the VMPS statistics to zero.&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>show vmps</tt></td>
  <td>This command produces a summary of VMPS configuration and status information, 
including whether VMPS is enabled or disabled, which station the VMPS server 
might be, what the TFTPserver address is, and what the VMPS database filename 
is.&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>show vmps mac</tt></td>
  <td>This command (on the VMPS server) shows the MAC to VLAN mapping table 
(the database). It also shows the last requestor, which tells you which switch
and switch port last had the end station in question attached to it, also
whether the request succeeded or was denied.&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>show vmps statistics</tt></td>
  <td>This command displays VMPS-related statistics. It can be useful for 
troubleshooting, since it shows you VQP requests, denied requests, and also
the MAC address of the end station associated with the last failed request.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>show vmps vlan <i>vlan-name</i></tt></td>
  <td>On the VMPS server, this shows all MAC addresses for a VLAN in the VMPS
configuration database.&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td><tt>show vmps vlanports <i>vlan-name</i></tt></td>
  <td>On a Catalyst 5xxx switch, shows the ports associated with the specified 
VLAN name.&nbsp;</td>

            </table>
  </p>
            <h3> Troubleshooting VMPS</h3>
  
            <h4> Ways that VMPS can fail to start up:</h4>
  
            <ul>
 <li> Failure to configure TFTP server address</li>
 
            </ul>
 There's an error message to this effect, that shows up when you try to configure
VMPS to be enabled. Do put the TFTP server address in! 
            <ul>
 <li> Unable to contact TFTP server</li>
 
            </ul>
 When you enable VMPS, the switch might not be able to contact the TFTP server.
Make sure the TFTP server is functioning (that is, it is up and running and
that TFTP on it is working), then check routing and connectivity between
the client switch and the TFTP server. 
            <ul>
 <li> The configuration file isn't found on the TFTP server.</li>
 
            </ul>
 Check case and spelling of the name on both ends, switch and TFTP server. 
            <ul>
 <li> Enable failure due to inadequate resources.</li>
 
            </ul>
 You're out of RAM on your switch, dude! 
            <h4> Ways VMPS/VQP and dynamic VLAN's can fail:</h4>
  
            <ul>
 <li> Client needs to see the attached endstation.</li>
 
            </ul>
 Check for link light, and check that the endstation is transmitting. (If 
it is not transmitting, the switch cannot learn its MAC address). 
            <ul>
 <li> Client to server query.</li>
 
            </ul>
 The client and server need to be able to send IP UDP packets between each 
other. Test with ping. Since you're probably not doing this through a router, 
traceroute should be irrelevant. 
            <ul>
 <li> Client needs to get a positive reply back.</li>
 
            </ul>
 If the client does not get a reply back, or if the reply that does come back
is a denied response, then (see below) the client is placed in a default VLAN
or the port is disabled. If you don't know this, you'll think there are link
or switch port problems instead! 
            <h3> IOS-Based Configuration (2900 XL Series)</h3>
 References: 
            <ul>
 <li> CCO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/c2900xl/29_35sa6/eescg/mascvmps.htm">
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/c2900xl/29_35sa6/eescg/mascvmps.htm</a>
              </li>
 
            </ul>
 The IOS-based XL switches are currently VQP but not VMPS capable (nor does 
it appear VMPS functionality will be added to them, they're primarily edge 
switches). 
            <p>To specify VMPS server, use the configuration command </p>
            <ul>
              <tt>vmps server <i>ipaddress</i> [primary]</tt>
            </ul>
 To check the effect of this, try 
            <blockquote><tt>show vmps</tt></blockquote>
 To make an interface (port) dynamic instead of static, configure 
              <blockquote><tt>interface fastethernet 0/1</tt> <br>
                <tt>switchport mode access</tt> <br>
                <tt>switchport access vlan dynamic</tt></blockquote>
 You can check this with 
                <blockquote><tt>show interface <i>interface</i> switchport</tt></blockquote>
 To have the switch re-check the dynamic port VLAN assignments, use the EXEC
mode command 
                  <blockquote><tt>vmps reconfirm</tt></blockquote>
 The default reconfirm interval is 60 minutes. The default number of retries 
on a VQP query are 3. You can configure these with 
                    <blockquote><tt>vmps reconfirm <i>minutes</i></tt> <br>
                      <tt>vmps retry <i>number-of-retries</i></tt></blockquote>
  
                      <h3> VMPS Configuration Database</h3>
 Here is a sample of the VMPS configuration database file that a VMPS server 
might download from a TFTP server. Note that the syntax is not well documented. 
The file must start with the VMPS domain name, which must match the VTP domain
(including case). Do NOT capitalize "<tt>vmps</tt>", the file contents are
case-sensitive (and in at least some of the Cisco documentation I've seen,
the Marketing Communications rewrite capitalized "<tt>vmps</tt>" as the name
of the protocol/acronym). 
                      <p>The second line of the sample below specifies security
mode, which can be either <tt>open</tt> or <tt>secure</tt>. In secure mode,
an unknown MAC address causes the port to be shut down. In open mode, unknown
MAC addresses are assigned to fallback (default) "unsecure" VLAN, specified 
with the <tt>vmps fallback</tt> line. The default mode is open. You can also
specify whether requests with no VTP/VMPS domain are allowed or denied. By
the way, when unknown MAC addresses or denied situations occur, the switch
can send a SNMP trap to your SNMP trap receiver (management station). This
might be useful for tracking use of unauthorized PC's in a campus environment
(provided that's something you care to manage). </p>
                      <blockquote><tt>vmps domain mydomain</tt> <br>
                        <tt>vmps mode open</tt> <br>
                        <tt>! vmps mode { open | secure }</tt> <br>
                        <tt>vmps fallback default</tt> <br>
                        <tt>vmps no-domain-req deny</tt> <br>
                        <tt>! vmps no-domain-req { allow | deny }</tt></blockquote>
 This section of the configuration database file is followed by the list of
MAC addresses and VLAN names: 
                        <blockquote><tt>vmps-mac-addrs</tt> <br>
                          <tt>!</tt> <br>
                          <tt>address 0012.2233.4455 vlan-name Engineering</tt>
 <br>
                          <tt>address 0012.3344.abcd vlan-name Engineering</tt>
 <br>
                          <tt>address aaaa.bbbb.cccc vlan-name Accounting</tt>
 <br>
                          <tt>address aaaa.bbbb.1111 vlan-name --NONE--</tt>
 <br>
                          <tt>address aaaa.bbbb.2222 vlan-name SecureAccounting</tt></blockquote>
 Note that "--NONE--" is a way of excluding an untrusted MAC address: the 
VMPS server will send a denied response to any queries. 
                          <p>You can apparently specify what devices are
allowed on what ports (I haven't tried this). Note that quotes are used when
the name contains a space. </p>
                          <blockquote><tt>! vmps-port-group &lt;group-name&gt;</tt>
 <br>
                            <tt>! device &lt;device-id&gt; { port &lt;port-name&gt;
| all-ports }</tt> <br>
                            <tt>!</tt> <br>
                            <tt>vmps-port-group WiringCloset1</tt> <br>
                            <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.1.1 port Fa1/3</tt> <br>
                            <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.1.2 port Fa1/4</tt> <br>
                            <tt>vmps-port-group "Executive Suite"</tt> <br>
                            <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.10.1 port Fa0/1</tt> <br>
                            <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.10.1 port Fa0/2</tt> <br>
                            <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.10.10 all-ports</tt></blockquote>
 You can then create groups of VLAN (names) and then policies as to which 
VLAN's are allowed on which ports (using the above port-groups): 
                            <blockquote><tt>! vmps-vlan-group &lt;group-name&gt;</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>! vlan-name &lt;vlan-name&gt;</tt> <br>
                              <tt>!</tt> <br>
                              <tt>vmps-vlan-group Engineering</tt> <br>
                              <tt>vlan-name hardware</tt> <br>
                              <tt>vlan-name software</tt> <br>
                              <tt>!</tt> <br>
                              <tt>!vmps-port-policies {vlan-name &lt;vlan_name&gt;
| vlan-group &lt;group-name&gt; }</tt> <br>
                              <tt>! { port-group &lt;group-name&gt; | device
&lt;device-id&gt; port &lt;port-name&gt; }</tt> <br>
                              <tt>!</tt> <br>
                              <tt>vmps-port-policies vlan-group Engineering</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>&nbsp;port-group WiringCloset1</tt> <br>
                              <tt>vmps-port-policies vlan-name Accounting</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.10.1 port Fa0/3</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>vmps-port-policies vlan-name Management</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>&nbsp;device 172.16.10.1 port Fa0/10</tt>
 <br>
                              <tt>&nbsp;port-group "Executive Suite"</tt></blockquote>
  
                              <h2> CiscoWorks 2000 and VMPS</h2>
 The User Tracking tool allows CW2000 to learn which users are on which ports
in which VLAN's. This can be handy for troubleshooting, since not just MAC
addresses but IP addresses can be picked up by the software (from ARP caches). 
                              <p>You can use the tool to then change multiple
switch ports to dynamic status. You can also use it to save the MAC address
information to TFTP server, and you can even trigger the VMPS server to download
fresh MAC address table information. </p>
                              <p>Oh, and you can use CiscoView (and SNMP)
to configure the VMPS servers and clients.&nbsp; We do a demo of all this
in the CEMS CiscoWorks 2000 course. </p>
                              <h2> Wrap-Up</h2>
 The question all of this leaves me with is, "how do you troubleshoot it when
it breaks". That is, dynamic VLAN's are nifty. Having multiple VMPS servers
means you probably won't have an entire campus down at one time. Nonetheless,
VQP adds one more thing that can go wrong. Troubleshooting it has so far
not been bad for me, but you do have to be careful with typos and do have
to make sure you have a good scheme for managing and communicating with your
switches (probably on VLAN 1). 
                              <p>I'm planning more switching topics for the
next month or two. We may also sneak in a little design: you need to think
about end-to-end VLAN's versus the "Layer 2 / Layer 3" hierarchical approach.
See you in a month! </p>
