WHAT IS OPENNAC?
----------------
OpenNAC provides easy to use dynmaic vlan assignment and LAN access control for Cisco Switches and all kinds of Network devices (PC, Printers, IP phones, Webcams..). 


Project DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
OpenNAC can be considered as current having two phases.

1) Version 1: We have taken OpenVMPS, added a MySQL backend, Delphi GUI, Web GUI, advanced PHP scripting control, scalability, redundancy, alerting etc. This has been installed commercially for 3 customers, and we wish to share this stable release via GPL with the community.

2) Version 2, the next phase: We are considering adding 802.1x support (better security, support of non Cisco switches), support for Nortel Swithes via SNMP, a real web interface. The sources on V1 have to be clean of commercial referneces, reviewd and will be published under the GPL.

We would like the project to move forward, offering an  OpenSource Enterprise tool for Dynamic Vlan Assignment and LAN Network authentication.

We wish to solicitate community opinions, expertise and feedback. Are people interested in this tool, would they like to use it, contribute to it (documentation, support, development, promotion, architecture, review etc.)?

Finally I should note that we hope to also sell the product, support etc. to generate revenue to pay for the main developers, while at the same time maintaining a GPL and a healthy community. 


We plan to release design, documentation and demos in July.
