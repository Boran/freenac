________ Tips on Working with Subversion _________
Checkout a working copy:
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/trunk/contrib
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/trunk/bin 
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/trunk/etc
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/trunk/web1
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/trunk/web2
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opennac/doc

Check for changes:	
svn update contrib bin etc doc
		svn help update
	
Make changes:
svn add <filename|directory>
svn delete <filename|directory>
svn copy <filename|directory>
svn move <filename|directory>
		svn help [ add | delete | copy | move ]

Examine your changes:
svn status doc bin etc contrib
svn status <filename|directory>
svn diff
svn diff > <patchfile>
svn revert <filename>
		svn help [ blame | status | diff | revert ]
		svn [ blame | praise ]

Commit your changes:
svn commit --username YOUR_SF_USER –m “your message“ contrib
svn commit --username YOUR_SF_USER –m “your message“ doc
svn commit --username YOUR_SF_USER –m “your message“ bin
svn commit --username YOUR_SF_USER –m “your message“ etc
svn help commit

--------- Subversion client settings ----------
For servers behind a proxy, edit ~/.subversion/servers and set
the proxy values:
  [groups]
  group1 = *svn.sourceforge.net
  [group1]
  http-proxy-host = proxy1.MYDOMAIN.COM 
  http-proxy-port = 80
  
Limit what files are checking into SVN, edit ~/.subversion/config
  [miscellany]
  global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store *,v RCS config.inc
Specifically, we don't want RCS files, or the productive config.inc
(with passwords) checked in
