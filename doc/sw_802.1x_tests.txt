
Lets say there is an access point on port 22, first set it to static and assign a trunk with the 
appropriate vlans:

set port membership 2/22 static
  Port 2/22 vlan assignment set to static.
  Spantree port fast start option set to default for ports 2/22.

set trunk 2/22 on
clear trunk 2/22
  Port(s)  2/22 trunk mode set to auto.
  Port(s)  2/22 trunk type set to dot1q.

sw0503> (enable) set trunk 2/22 11-12,15
Vlan(s) 11-12,15 already allowed on the trunk
Please use the 'clear trunk' command to remove vlans from allowed list.
