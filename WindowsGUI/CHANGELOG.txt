v3.0.0.152/3.1.08/SB: 
  Add feature to connect to a Secondary server, for FreeNAC v3.01 which has a "multi-master" mysql replication setup.
  To enable this, add a "server2" entry after the vmps > mysql > server  entry in vmps.xml
  A additional connection button then appears on the GUI.
  There is no automated detection of primary/secondary connection status, its up to the users to decide which connnect button to press.

v3.0.0.156/15.Mar.08/SB:  
	Users: Seperate search fields - less confusion
	Switch - locations lookup was limited to 22
  Ports/Switches: show id	column
	Switch: add new Switch: name was being forgotten.
	Locations: sort by building, then name.
	Check for gui_disable_ports_list config option.
	  The idea is that the network admin does NOT want FreeNAC to control centrain ports.
	  So, he/she sets a comment on a port, which is then discovered
	  and written into the ports table via snmp_scan. If the port comments contains one of
	  a special list of string, the port may not be edited or restarted by FreeNAC.
	  So, lets say we want to block ports with either the words "reserved" or "blocked"
	  in the port comment:
		insert into config set name='gui_disable_ports_list', value='reserved,forbidden', type='string', comment='GUI: disable editing ports with a comment containing one of these comma seperated values';	
	When checking for guidomain, log more details to the server log.

v3.0.0.158/9.May.08/SB:

  Add "hubs" to Reports. Re-enable domain exceptions.
  
v3.0.0.159/13.May.08/SB:  
  Add Customisation of the Grid layouts:
  New Load/Save (grid) Layouts to the admin menu. If USERNAME.ini exists after connection,
  load the grid layouts in it.
  To use: delete [USERNAME].ini if there is one in your vmps folder. Start vmps.exe. Customise the grids
  the way you want (make columns visible, change width, orders etc.). Then do Admin > Save Layout.
  This save the layouts to USERNAME.ini and will be loaded automaticallly each time.
