_______________________ FreeNAC README _____________________________

FreeNAC provides Virtual LAN assignment and LAN access control for Cisco switches based on vmps.
It can also live network end-device discovery via SNMP.
802.1x can also be used for device authentication.

The project has been in "maintenance mode" since 2009, meaning the core developers 
fix issues for their installs, but don't have time/resources/lab for new features. 
Co-maintainers are needed. If you wish to contribute fork on github and tell us!
- The main Project Website is now Github, not sourceforge. 
- There is no forum or mailing list any more (too much spam), please use the issue queue on Github (https://github.com/Boran/freenac/issues).
- Legacy documentations is on FreeNAC.net.

Please use the latest code from the master branch on guthub https://github.com/Boran/freenac

Some support information is in English/french/Spanish and German.
