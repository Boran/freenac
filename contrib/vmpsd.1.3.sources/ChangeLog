- on SIGHUP now rereads its database, 
  contributed by Alex Dawson ( alex _at_ ee.uwa.edu.au )

0.01 -> 1.0
-----------

- bump version number, so people will stop asking me if this
  is any good with such low version number ;), after all 1.0 is well
  deserved, we run it for more than two years now (aug 2003) and
  till now the network has grown to ~40 switches and ~700 hosts
  (actually ~800, but some 120 clients are still in todo list for
   dynamic vlans)

- compilation on Solaris should work now,
  tested with gcc, gmake, Solaris 9

- should run properly on non i386 arch now, tested on SPARC

- fixed wrong log level command line option handling ( -l )

- fixed wrong parameter handling for bind address ( -a ) 

- fixed fallback vlan bug
