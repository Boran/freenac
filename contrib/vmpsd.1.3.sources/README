What is it?
-----------

OpenVMPS is a substitute implementation of Cisco Virtual 
Membership Policy Server (on Catalyst [65]500 family of switches).
It is used on Cisco LAN switces to dynamically assign ports
to VLANs according to Ethernet Address. Because it was
developed solely on infomation obtained by observing the
network traffic between switches it is probably not complete
but it is a working subset of the protocol. More on VMPS you
can find on www.cisco.com, search for VMPS.
